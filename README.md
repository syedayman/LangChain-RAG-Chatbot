# LangChain RAG MultiPDF Chatbot
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI chatbot application built with LangChain and Google Gemini that enables users to upload multiple PDF documents and engage in intelligent conversations about their content. The app processes uploaded PDFs, creates vector embeddings for efficient document retrieval, and combines this with LLM capabilities to provide contextually relevant answers to user queries. Built with a clean Streamlit interface, the application offers real-time document processing, maintains conversation history, and leverages advanced RAG techniques to deliver accurate, source-grounded responses based on the uploaded material.
